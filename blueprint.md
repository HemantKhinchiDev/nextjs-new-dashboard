# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a Next.js application that I am helping to build and maintain. It includes a dashboard with invoices and customer management.

## Implemented Features

*   **Initial Project Setup:** Basic Next.js application with default structure.
*   **Dashboard Layout:** Created a dashboard layout with a side navigation bar.
*   **Placeholder Data Fix:** Resolved a build error by reordering the `customers` and `invoices` data in `placeholder-data.ts`.

## Current Plan

*   Commit the recent changes to the git repository.
